        <h1>English</h1>
        <p>
            Throughout the year, English lessons have given us the opportunity to communicate in a different language in meaningful contexts, especially those related to computer      <br>
            science, but also in cultural and historical discussions. This kind of preparation is particularly useful in case we pursue work abroad or find ourselves in international  <br>
            environments. It also allowed us to deepen our understanding of key events in modern history. In particular, we studied the Cold War and one of its early episodes: the     <br>
            Berlin Blockade. On June 24, 1948, the Soviet Union blocked all access to West Berlin in response to the introduction of the Deutschmark in West Germany and the launch     <br>
            of the U.S. Marshall Plan aimed at countering communism. As a response, NATO member countries organized an airlift to supply West Berlin with essential goods,              <br>
            bypassing the Soviet blockade.                                                                                                                                              <br>
